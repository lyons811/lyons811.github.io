## TypeScript Experience so far 

TypeScript so far has been fairly interesting. For me, it reminds me a lot of C/C++. In those languages, you already define what type the variables/functions are when you define them. So in JavaScript, it was a bit of a surprise when I found out that you just define variables with no type at all and let JS figure the rest out. TypeScript, on the other hand, feels a lot like C/C++, with having to define what type a variable should be. Though so far, I feel like it's a bit more flexible with how you can define variables, i.e., using any type. 

Overall, from my limited exposure this past week, TypeScript feels like any old programming language but with more handle on the railings compared to C. From a software engineering perspective, I feel like it's a good programming language, though I can see having to define every function/variable might be tiresome and might just regress into regular JavaScript. 

I've never had a class where we had WODs before, so this was a surprise. Overall, I find it useful. We get to first practice and then try out in a limited time setting, and then see what we did and how we could improve on it. I think it's pretty useful and helps us keep leveled on what we should be learning and testing us on our progress so far.

# UH Manoa Ride Share

## Overview

UH Manoa Ride Share is a web application designed to address a critical challenge faced by UH Manoa students: the difficulties of campus commuting. With limited, expensive parking and sometimes inconvenient public transportation options, many students resort to driving alone, contributing to increased traffic, higher transportation costs, and elevated carbon emissions.

Our solution connects students who share similar routes and schedules, facilitating an efficient carpooling system that benefits both the community and the environment.

## Goals

- **Reduce Transportation Costs**: Help students save money by sharing commuting expenses
- **Ease Parking Demand**: Decrease the number of single-occupancy vehicles requiring parking on campus
- **Environmental Impact**: Lower carbon emissions by promoting shared rides
- **Community Building**: Foster connections between students through collaborative transportation
- **Enhanced Safety**: Implement features to ensure secure and reliable ride sharing

## Technical Implementation

Here's a code snippet demonstrating how we generate our prisma db. 
```javascript
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id             Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  email          String        @unique
  password       String
  role           Role          @default(USER)
  avatarUrl      String?

  updatedAt      DateTime      @updatedAt
  offeredRides   Ride[]        @relation("DriverRides")
  bookedRides    RideBooking[]
}

model Ride {
  id             Int           @id @default(autoincrement())
  driverId       Int
  startLocation  String
  endLocation    String
  departureTime  DateTime
  availableSeats Int
  status         RideStatus    @default(PENDING)
  description    String?
  createdAt      DateTime      @default(now())
  updatedAt      DateTime      @updatedAt
  driver         User          @relation("DriverRides", fields: [driverId], references: [id])
  bookings       RideBooking[]

  @@index([driverId])
}

model RideBooking {
  id          Int        @id @default(autoincrement())
  rideId      Int
  passengerId Int
  status      RideStatus @default(PENDING)
  createdAt   DateTime   @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime   @updatedAt
  passenger   User       @relation(fields: [passengerId], references: [id])
  ride        Ride       @relation(fields: [rideId], references: [id])

  @@unique([rideId, passengerId])
  @@index([rideId])
  @@index([passengerId])
}

model Stuff {
  id        Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  quantity  Int
  condition Condition
  owner     String
}

enum Role {
  USER
  ADMIN
}

enum RideStatus {
  PENDING
  ACTIVE
  COMPLETED
  CANCELLED
}

enum Condition {
  excellent
  good
  fair
  poor
}
